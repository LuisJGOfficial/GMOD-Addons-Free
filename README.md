This post was created with the intention that people who do not have the money to enjoy this game can do so now and this time with the latest version known so far.

Garry's Mod or better known as GMod, is a sandbox video game developed by Facepunch Studios and published by Valve that allows the user to manipulate objects and experiment with physics with its legendary weapon "Physics Gun". It uses a modified version of the Source engine, which uses video game elements such as those that appear in The Orange Box and Left 4 Dead, although it later became an independent game with the same content.
